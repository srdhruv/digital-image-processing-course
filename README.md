<h4>Exercise 2</h4>

Objective: To understand the concept of aliasing and false contouring.


Convert the given Lena image to grayscale image. Use the cv2.resize() to down sample the image with 4 sizes  (128*128, 64*64, 32*32, and 16*16).  Display  the original image, and down sampled images with the same display size. Observe what happens
Down sample the grayscale Lena image with  8 different intensity ranges of values (0-255, 0-127, 0-63, 0-31, 0-15, 0-7, 0-3, and 0-1). (Note: Size of images are the same). And display all those 8 downsampled images  in the same size display area on the screen. Observe what happens

<h4>Exercise 3</h4>

Objective:
1. Take a Lena image and convert it into grayscale. Create 10 noisy versions of the Lena image by adding additive Gaussian noise with the original image. Take the average of noisy images and display the same. Report the observation made.

2. Take a Lena image and scale it by factors of 1,2,0.5 using bilinear and nearest neighbor interpolation methods. Display the scaled images. Also, display the output of built-in functions for doing scaling by factors of 0.5,1 and 2. Compare the results.
